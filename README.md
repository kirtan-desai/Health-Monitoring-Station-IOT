# Health-Monitoring-Station-IOT
IOT devices is used in many fields which make the userâ€™s daily life more comfortable. Many smart sensors are used to measure and detect different health indicators but it becomes expensive and tedious to have different health monitoring devices. Temperature, humidity and heart rate are the most common and basic health detectors needed for every patient in any health care facility. Hence in this project we have tried to integrate all these health indicators into a single health monitoring station which communicates over Bluetooth to a desired device.
